## 🧠 Overview

URAM is a student-founded pre-startup team from Korea University and Seoul National University, proposing a sustainable business to address food waste disposal and energy dependency by converting food waste into solid fuel pellets using fast-growing kenaf plants.

## 💡 Business Idea

**Title**: Production of solid fuel pellets from food waste and kenaf biomass

We propose converting chemically stored energy in food waste into usable solid fuel. Kenaf is a fast-growing plant (130 tons/ha biomass productivity) with high calorific value, excellent carbon sequestration, and minimal environmental impact. URAM's pellet product will:

* Reduce secondary pollution by recycling waste
* Offer stable supply at affordable prices
* Create an energy recovery value of \~60,000 KRW per ton

## 🏭 Social Issues We Address

### 1. Food Waste Treatment in Korea

* High water and salt content makes food waste hard to reuse as feed or for methane production
* High treatment costs (\~800 billion KRW/year) and CO₂ emissions (\~8.85 million tons CO₂e)

### 2. Lack of Domestic Pellet Production

* Korea imports 90%+ of its wood pellets
* \~400–800 billion KRW leaves Korea yearly

### 3. Coal Dependency

* 312 million tons of CO₂ emitted from coal-fired plants
* High geopolitical risk from energy imports (e.g., Russia-EU energy crisis)

## 🔍 Market Environment

### Domestic Pellet Market (2021)

* Total: 3.84 million tons (only 17.2% domestic)

### Policies

* Korea enforces quality standards for solid fuel products
* Waste Resource Energy Management System registered

### Customers

* Cement kilns (e.g., 1.27 million tons of alternative fuel use in 2017)
* Biomass power plants (e.g., GS EPS: 2x105MW)

## 🔬 Technology & Solution

* Mechanical-Biological Treatment (MBT) process with added kenaf
* Collaboration with food waste powder producer for raw materials
* Goal: Develop optimized formula for maximum combustion efficiency

## 💰 Business Model

* Source: Food waste powder (free) + kenaf (150 KRW/kg)
* Cost: 200 KRW/kg vs. market price of 300–400 KRW/kg
* Competitive edge: 25% cheaper than existing pellets

## 📊 Budget Plan (Total: 10 million KRW)

* 7M: Prototype outsourcing
* 1.5M: Patent application
* 1M: R\&D & operations
* 0.5M: Team activity support

## 🌍 Expected Impact

### Environmental

* CO₂ reduction via kenaf (3–9x more effective than typical plants)
* Improved soil quality, domestic energy independence

### Economic

* Pellet market import substitution (worth billions)
* Added value per ton: \~61,730 KRW

### Employment

* Kenaf farming creates 2.5x more jobs than coal
* 135,100ha = full replacement of imported pellets = rural job growth
